## About the Exam

The CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601) represents the latest and greatest in cybersecurity, covering the most in-demand skills related to current threats, automation, zero trust, IoT, risk – and more. Once certified, you’ll understand the core skills needed to succeed on the job – and employers will notice too. The Security+ exam verifies you have the knowledge and skills required to:  
     
* Assess the security posture of an enterprise environment and recommend and implement appropriate security solutions.
* Monitor and secure hybrid environments, including cloud, mobile, Internet of Things (IoT), and operational technology.
* Operate with an awareness of applicable regulations and policies, including principles of governance, risk, and compliance. 
* Identify, analyze, and respond to security events and incidents. 

CompTIA Security+ is compliant with ISO 17024 standards and approved by the U.S. DoD to meet Directive 8140.03M requirements. Regulators and government rely on ANSI accreditation because it provides confidence and trust in the outputs of an accredited program. Over 3 million CompTIA ISO/ANSI-accredited exams have been delivered since January 1, 2011.  
  
CompTIA Network+ candidates are recommended to have the following:
* **CompTIA Network+ certification or equivalent knowledge**
* **At least 2 years of experience in IT administration with a security focus**

### EXAM ACCREDITATION

The CompTIA Network+ exam is accredited by ANSI to show compliance with the ISO 17024 standard and, as such, undergoes regular reviews and updates to the exam objectives.

### EXAM DEVELOPMENT

CompTIA exams result from subject-matter expert workshops and industry-wide survey results regarding the skills and knowledge required of an entry-level IT professional.
