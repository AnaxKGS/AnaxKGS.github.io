            "question": "Alekos is a sales manager with a major insurance company. He has received an email that is encouraging him to click on a link and fill out a survey. He is suspicious of the email, but it does mention a major insurance association, and that makes him think it might be legitimate. Which of the following best describes this attack? ",
            "options": [
              "Phishing",
              "Social Engineering",

              "Trojan Horse"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The correct answer is spear phishing. Spear phishing is targeted to a specific group, in this case insurance professionals. Although this is a form of phishing, the more specific answer is the one you will need to choose on questions like this. Phishing uses social engineering techniques to succeed but is once again a broader answer than spear phishing and thus is not the correct choice. Finally, a Trojan horse pretends to be a legitimate or desirable program or file, which this scenario doesn’t describe."

            "question": "You are a security administrator for a medium-sized bank. You have discovered a piece of software on your bank's database server that is not supposed to be there. It appears that the software will begin deleting database files if a specific employee is terminated. What best describes this?",
            "options": [
              "Worm",
              "Logic Bomb",
              "Trojan Horse",
              "Rootkit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A logic bomb is malware that performs its malicious activity when some condition is met. A worm is malware that self-propagates. A Trojan horse is malware attached to a legitimate program, and a rootkit is malware that gets root or administrative privileges."

            "question": "You are responsible for incident response at Acme Bank. The Acme Bank website has been attacked. The attacker used the login screen, but rather than enter login credentials, they entered some odd text: \n' or '1' = '1 .What is the best description for this attack?",
            "options": [
              "Cross-site scripting",
              "Cross-site request forgery",
              "SQL injection",
              "ARP poisoning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This is a very basic form of SQL injection. Cross-site scripting would have JavaScript in the text field and would be designed to impact other sites from a user’s session. Cross-site request forgery would not involve any text being entered in the web page, and ARP poisoning is altering the ARP table in a switch; it is not related to website hacking."

            "question": "Users are complaining that they cannot connect to the wireless network. You discover that the WAPs are being subjected to a wireless attack designed to block their Wi-Fi signals. Which of the following is the best label for this attack?",
            "options": [
              "IV attack",
              "Jamming",
              "WPS attack ",
              "Botnet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This describes a jamming attack, where legitimate traffic is interfered with by another signal. Jamming can be intentional or unintentional and may be intermittent. IV attacks are obscure cryptographic attacks on stream ciphers. Wi-Fi protected setup (WPS) uses a PIN to connect to the wireless access point (WAP). The WPS attack attempts to intercept that PIN in transmission, connect to the WAP, and then steal the WPA2 password. A botnet is a group of machines that are being used, without their consent, as part of an attack."

            "question": "Frank is deeply concerned about attacks to his company's e-commerce server. He is particularly worried about cross-site scripting and SQL injection. Which of the following would best defend against these two specific attacks? ",
            "options": [
              "Encrypted web traffic",
              "Input validation",
              "A firewall",
              "An IDS"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The best option listed to defend against the attacks mentioned is input validation. Encrypting the web traffic will not have any effect on these two attacks. A web application firewall (WAF) might mitigate these attacks, but it would be secondary to input validation, and an intrusion detection system (IDS) will simply detect the attack—it won’t stop it."

            "question": "You are responsible for network security at Acme Company. Users have been reporting that personal data is being stolen when using the wireless network. They all insist they only connect to the corporate wireless access point (AP). However, logs for the AP show that these users have not connected to it. Which of the following could best explain this situation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If users have been connecting but the AP does not show them connecting, then they have been connecting to a rogue access point. This could be the cause of an architecture and design weakness such as a network without segmentation and control of devices connecting to the network. Session hijacking involves taking over an already authenticated session. Most session hijacking attacks involve impersonation. The attacker attempts to gain access to another user’s session by posing as that user. Clickjacking involves causing visitors to a website to click on the wrong item. Finally, bluejacking is a Bluetooth attack. "

              "Bluejacking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cross-site scripting involves entering a script into text areas that other users will view. SQL injection is not about entering scripts, but rather SQL commands. Clickjacking is about tricking users into clicking on the wrong thing. Bluejacking is a Bluetooth attack."

            "question": "Rick wants to make offline brute-force attacks against his password file very difficult for attackers. Which of the following is not a common technique to make passwords harder to crack? ",
            "options": [
              "Use of a salt",
              "Use of a pepper",

              "Encrypting password plain text using symmetric encryption"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Retaining the actual password is not a best practice, and thus encrypting password plain text is not a common technique to make passwords harder to crack. Since the application would need the cryptographic key to read the passwords, anybody who had access to that key could decrypt the passwords. Using a salt, a pepper, and a cryptographic hashing algorithm designed for passwords are all common best practices to prevent offline brute-force attacks."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Although this is one of the more dated items on the Security+ exam outline, you need to know that the term for Internet messaging spam messages is SPIM. The rest of the answers were made up, and though this shows up in the exam outline, the rest of the world has moved on from using this term. "

            "question": "Susan is analyzing the source code for an application and discovers a pointer de-reference and returns NULL. This causes the program to attempt to read from the NULL pointer and results in a segmentation fault. What impact could this have for the application?",
            "options": [
              "A data breach",
              "A denial-of-service condition",

              "Privilege escalation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A segmentation fault will typically stop the program from running. This type of issue is why a NULL pointer or other pointer de-referencing error is considered a potential security issue, as a denial-of-service condition impacts the availability of the service. This type of error is unlikely to cause a data breach or allow privilege escalation, and permissions creep occurs as individuals accrue more permissions over time in a single organization as their permissions are not cleaned up when they switch positions or roles."

            "question": "Myrsini is the security manager for a mid-sized insurance company. She receives a call from law enforcement, telling her that some computers on her network participated in a massive denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Teresa is certain that none of the employees at her company would be involved in a cybercrime. What would best explain this scenario?",
            "options": [
              "It is a result of social engineering.",
              "The machines all have backdoors.",

              "The machines are infected with crypto-viruses."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The machines in her network are being used as bots, and the users are not aware that they are part of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. Social engineering is when someone tries to manipulate you into giving information. Techniques involved in social engineering attacks include consensus, scarcity, and familiarity. There is a slight chance that all computers could have a backdoor, but that is very unlikely, and attackers normally don’t manually log into each machine to do a DDoS—it would be automated, as through a bot."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "There are many indicators of compromise (IoCs), including unusual outbound network traffic, geographical irregularities like logins from a country where the person normally does not work, or increases in database read volumes beyond normal traffic patterns. Predictive analysis is analysis work done using datasets to attempt to determine trends and likely attack vectors so that analysts can focus their efforts where they will be most needed and effective. OSINT is open source intelligence, and threat maps are often real-time or near real-time visualizations of where threats are coming from and where they are headed to."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When troubleshooting TCP handshakes, the most valuable tool in many cases is packet capture. If Chris sees a series of SYN packets without the handshake being completed, he can be reasonably sure the firewall is blocking traffic. Reviewing reports or logs may be useful for this as well but won’t show the TCP handshake issue mentioned in the problem, and sentiment analysis is focused on how individuals and groups are responding, not on a technical problem."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "User behavior analysis is a key capability when attempting to detect potential insider threats. Chris can use his SIEM’s behavioral analysis capabilities to detect improper or illicit use of rights and privileges as \nwell as abnormal behavior on the part of his users. Sentiment analysis helps analyze feelings, and log aggregation and security monitoring provide ways to gain insight into the overall security posture and status of the organization."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Using log aggregation to pull together logs from multiple sources, and performing collection and initial analysis on log collectors can help centralize and handle large log volumes. Capturing packets is useful for network traffic analysis to identify issues or security concerns. Security monitoring is an overall function for security information and event management (SIEM) and doesn’t specifically help with this need. Both sentiment analysis and user behavior analysis are aimed at users and groups rather than at how data is collected and managed."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The simplest way to ensure that APIs are only used by legitimate users is to require the use of authentication. API keys are one of the most frequently \nused methods for this. If an API key is lost or stolen, the key can be invalidated and reissued, and since API keys can be matched to usage, Irene’s company can also bill customers based on their usage patterns if they want to. A firewall or IP restrictions may be able to help, but they can be fragile; customer IP addresses may change. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) can detect and prevent attacks, but legitimate usage would be hard to tell from those who are not customers using \nan IPS."

            "explanation": "Buffer overflow attacks cram more data into a field or buffer than they can accept, overflowing into other \nmemory locations and either crashing the system or application, or potentially allowing code to be inserted into executable locations. Bluesnarfing and bluejacking are both Bluetooth attacks. Cross-site scripting attacks allow attackers to inject scripts into pages viewed by \nother users."

            "explanation": "Attackers are attempting to influence Simos with a combination of scarcity and urgency. Thus, for this question you should answer scarcity since urgency is not listed. In many social engineering principle questions, more than one of the principles may be in play, and you will need to answer with the principle that is correct or more correct for the question. In this case, there is no intimidation or claim to authority, and consensus would require some form of validation from \nothers. "

            "explanation": "Username complexity has no impact in credential harvesting. Multifactor authentication can help prevent successful credential harvesting by ensuring that even capture of username and password is not enough to compromise the account. Awareness training helps to reduce the likelihood of credential exposure, and limiting or preventing use of third-party web scripts makes websites less likely to have credentials stolen through the use of those scripts, plug-ins, or modules."

This may occur because of a compromised account or due to a breach of the domain registrar’s security. A common issue is a lapsed domain being purchased by a third party, and this can look like a hijacked domain, but it is a legitimate occurrence if the domain is not renewed! DNS hijacking inserts false information into a DNS server, on-path (man-in-the-middle) attacks capture or modify traffic by causing the traffic to pass through a compromised midpoint, and zero-day attacks are attacks that use an unknown until used vulnerability."

            "explanation": "Elicitation, or the process of eliciting information through conversation to gather useful information, is a key tool in a penetration tester’s social engineering arsenal. Pretexting involves the use of believable reasons for the target to go along with whatever the social engineering is attempting to do. Impersonation involves acting like someone you are not, whereas intimidation attempts to scare or threaten the target into doing what the social engineer wants them to."

For this reason, it should be conducted outside normal business hours or in a test environment, if it is used at all. A nonintrusive scan attempts to identify vulnerabilities without exploiting them. A penetration test actually attempts to breach the network by exploiting vulnerabilities. An audit is primarily a document check.

Although brute forcing is technically correct, the best match here is password spraying. When you encounter questions like this on the test, make sure you provide the most accurate answer, rather than one that fits but may not be the best answer.

Thus, you need to know that when it is used for this exam it can mean one of three things: adding an expression or phrase to an email, subject line, or headers to either protect or fool users. They also note that it can be used when adding data as part of an attack, and that social engineers may “prepend” information by inserting it into conversation to get targets to think about things the attacker wants them to. Pretexing is a social engineering technique where attackers use a reason that is intended to be believable to the target for what they are doing.

Alekos’s best option from the list provided is to enable PowerShell logging and then to review the logs on systems he believes are infected. Since fileless viruses don’t use files, an image of the disk is unlikely to provide much useful data. Disabling the administrative user won’t have an impact, since the compromise will happen inside the account of whichever user is logged in and impacted by the malware.

            "explanation": "Cross-site request forgery (XSRF or CSRF) takes advantage of the cookies and URL parameters legitimate sites use to help track and serve their visitors. In an XSRF or a CSRF attack, attackers leverage authorized, authenticated users’ rights by providing them with a cookie or session data that will be read and processed when they visit the target site. An attacker may embed a link within an email or other location that will be clicked or executed by the user or an automated process with that user’s session already open. This is not SQL injection, which would attempt to send commands to a database, or LDAP injection, which gathers data from a directory server.

            "explanation": "URL redirection has many legitimate uses, from redirecting traffic from no-longer-supported links to current replacements to URL shortening, but URL redirection was commonly used for phishing attacks. Modern browsers display the full, real URL, helping to limit the impact of this type of attack. Certificate expiration tracking is used to ensure that website certificates are current, but it does not prevent URL redirection attacks. JavaScript being enabled or disabling cookies is not helpful for this purpose either"

In this case, Kimon used physical access to the system to modify it, allowing him to then conduct a privilege escalation \nattack as an unprivileged user. A Trojan would have required a file to act like it was desirable, a denial-of-service attack would have prevented access to a system or service, and swapfiles (or pagefiles) are drive space used to contain the contents of memory when memory runs low.

            "explanation": "Bug bounties are increasingly common and can be quite lucrative. Bug bounty websites match vulnerability researchers with organizations that are willing to pay for information about issues with their software or services. Ransoms are sometimes demanded by attackers, but this is not a ransom since it was voluntarily paid as part of a reward system. A zero-day disclosure happens when a vulnerability is disclosed and the organization has not been previously informed and allowed to fix the issue. Finally, you might feel like $10,000 is a payday, but the term is not used as a technical term and doesn’t appear on the exam."

Setting permissions like this is a common workaround when permissions aren’t working but can expose data or make binaries executable by users who should not have access to them.

            "explanation": "Lighting and utility systems, as well as SCADA, PLCs, CNC, scientific equipment and similar devices are types of operational technology. Since this is a distributed attack that results in a denial of service, it is a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. OT systems are often isolated or otherwise protected from remote network connections to prevent this type of attack since many OT devices do not have strong security controls or frequent updates. A SCADA overflow is not a term used in the industry, but network and application DDoS attacks do appear on the Security+ exam outline, and you will need to be able to differentiate them from this type of OT DDoS."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A false negative occurs with a vulnerability scanning system when a scan is run and an issue that exists is not identified. This can be because of a configuration option, a firewall, or other security setting or because the vulnerability scanner is otherwise unable to detect the issue. A missing vulnerability update might be a concern if the problem did not specifically state that the definitions are fully up-to-date. Unless the vulnerability is so new that there is no definition, a missing update shouldn’t be the issue. Silent patching refers to a patching technique that does not show messages to users that a patch is occurring. A false positive would have caused a vulnerability to show that was not actually there. This sometimes happens when a patch or fix is installed but the application does not change in a way that shows the change."

He will be able to determine if the attack is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, and the IPS may be able to help him determine the source of the denial-of-service attack. A firewall might provide some useful information but would only show whether or not traffic was allowed and would not analyze the traffic for attack information. A vulnerability scanner would indicate if there was an issue with his application or the server, but it would not identify this type of attack. Antimalware software can help find malware on the system but isn’t effective against a DoS attack."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vendor diversity gives two security benefits. The first is that there is no single point of failure should one vendor cease operations. The second benefit is that each vendor has a specific methodology and algorithms used for detecting malware. If you use the same vendor at all points where you need malware detection, any flaw or weakness in that vendor’s methodology will persist across the network. Using a single vendor means that any weakness in that vendor’s methodology or technology could impact the entire system or network. Vendor forking is not a term in the industry, and this is not a neutral act; vendor diversity improves security."

            "explanation": "In this scenario, the best fit to Sakis's needs is a second network attached storage (NAS) device with a full copy of the primary NAS. In a failure scenario, the secondary NAS can simply take the place of the primary NAS while individual disks or even the whole NAS is replaced. Tape-based backups take longer to restore, regardless of whether they are full or incremental backups, although incremental backups can take more time in some cases since swapping tapes in order can add time to the restoration process. Finally, a cloud-based backup system would be useful if Sakis was worried about a local disaster but would be slower than a local identical NAS, thus not meeting Sakis’s primary requirement."

Restoration order can also ensure that the proper security controls are in place before systems are online. A datacenter should be able to handle systems coming online without failing if its power systems are properly designed. A second outage due to failed systems would mean that Mikaela has not determined why the outage has occurred, making restoration potentially dangerous or problematic.

This prevents malware from infecting the backup server. A separate VLAN or physical network segment can enhance security but is not as effective as air gapping. A honeynet is used to detect attacks against a network, but it doesn’t provide effective defense against malware in this scenario."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "After quantum encryption and decryption technologies become mainstream, it is generally believed that nonquantum cryptosystems will be defeated with relative ease, meaning that quantum cryptography will be required to be secure. Qubits are quantum bits, not a measure of speed; quantum encryption will be the relevant solution in a post-quantum encryption world; and even very long RSA keys are expected to be vulnerable."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Counter mode (CTR) makes a block cipher into a stream cipher by generating a keystream block using a nonrepeating sequence to fill in the blocks. This allows data to be streamed instead of waiting for blocks to be ready to send. It does not perform the reverse, turning a stream cipher into a block cipher, nor does it reverse the encryption process (decryption). Public keys cannot unlock private keys; they are both part of an asymmetric encryption process."

            "explanation": "Application programming interface (API) keys are frequently used to meet this need. An API key can be issued to an individual or organization, and then use of the API can be tracked to each API key. If the API key is compromised or abused, it can be revoked and a new API key can be issued. Firewall rules written to use public IP addresses can be fragile, since IP addresses may change or organizations may have a broad range of addresses that may be in use, making it hard to validate which systems or users are using the API. Credentials, including passwords, are not as frequently used as API keys."

            "explanation": "Honeypots are systems configured to appear to be vulnerable. Once an attacker accesses them, they capture data and tools while causing the attacker to think that they are successfully gaining control of the system. This allows defenders like Dimitria to study and analyze their techniques and tools without endangering their production systems. An intrusion detection system (IDS) or intrusion protection system (IPS) can detect and stop attacks, and may even capture some tools, but they are not designed to capture local commands and downloaded tools.

            "explanation": "Maria should implement ongoing auditing of the account usage on the SCADA system. This will provide a warning that someone’s account is being used when they are not actually using it. Host-based antivirus is almost never a bad idea, but this scenario did not indicate that the compromise was due to malware, so antimalware may not address the threat. Since the engineer has access to the SCADA system, a network intrusion prevention system (NIPS) is unlikely to block them from accessing the system, and full-disk encryption (FDE) will not mitigate this threat because the system is live and running, meaning that the disk will be decrypted in use."

An HSM is a physical device that safeguards and manages digital keys. Full-disk encryption (FDE) will protect the data on the e-commerce server, but it won’t help store the key. It is also difficult to fully encrypt the e-commerce server drive, since the drive will need to be in use for the e-commerce to function. A self-encrypting drive (SED) is merely automatic full-disk encryption. Software-defined networking (SDN) won’t address the issues in this scenario, since it configures networks via software and does not provide secure key storage."

This will allow testing of security features, as well as checking to see that the code integrates with the entire system. Using third-party libraries and software development kits (SDKs) can help reduce errors and vulnerabilities in the code.

Smartcard readers and maintenance do add\radditional expense, and user experiences are limited by\rthe need to have the card in hand and insert it or\rpresent it to a reader either during authentication or\rfor entire sessions.

            "explanation": "Least connection-based load balancing takes load\rinto consideration and sends the next request to the\rserver with the least number of active sessions. Round\rrobin simply distributes requests to each server in order, whereas weighted time uses health checks to\rdetermine which server responds the most quickly on\ran ongoing basis and then sends the traffic to that\rserver. Finally, source IP hashing uses the source and\rdestination IP addresses to generate a hash key and\rthen uses that key to track sessions, allowing\rinterrupted sessions to be reallocated to the same\rserver and thus allowing the sessions to continue."
